        <h1>Resume</h1>
        <p>Hello. I'm <b>Vladimir Ciobanu</b> and I'm a <b>senior software developer</b> specialised in <b>web development</b> - both server and client side.</p>
        <p>I have been writing software professionally for <b>10 years</b>, on projects such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li>cloud SaaS business applications,</li>
            <li>CMS/news websites,</li>
            <li>eLearning platform and</li>
            <li>patient medical registry.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="me" class="step slide" data-x="-1000" data-y="-1500">
        <p>I <b>love</b> writing software. Especially when it involves using <b>new tehnologies</b>. Even more so when it requires me to <b>learn something new</b>. I read about new software, articles and blogs whenever I can.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy <b>solving problems</b>. I'm usually that guy everyone in the team comes to for advice, suggestions, debugging or fixing issues.</p>
        <p>My ideal job would be one where I could <b>research</b> all the new tehnologies, find <b>solutions to problems</b> (of any kind: scalability, usability, testablity, etc). I'm very <b>passionate</b> about <b>software</b>.</p>
        <p>Software engineering is my job and my hobby (amongst a few others).</p>
    </div>

    <div id="tehnology" class="step slide" data-x="0" data-y="-1500">
        <p>I'm currently writing software using the <b>Microsoft</b> tehnology stack. Specifically, I'm mostly using the <b>.NET Framework</b> and <b>C#</b> (ASP.NET MVC, Javascript, SQL Server, IIS, etc).</p>
        <p>I'm the <b>leader</b> of a <b>three man web development team</b>. The projects my team delivered were <b>highly appreciated</b> by our customers. I also belive that I've helped my team <b>grow professionally</b>.</p>
        <p>I'm also sold on <b>Agile Devleopment</b>, <b>eXtreme Programming</b> and <b>SCRUM</b>. Although I don't belive in following all the rules blindly, I think a lot of them are very useful in all software devleopment stages.</p>

        <h1>Software</h1>
        <p>As a <b>team leader</b>, I have experience <b>designing software applications</b> from ground up. I am able to assess the <b>software needs</b> of a business, department or process and come up with a <b>flexible</b>, <b>extensible</b> and <b>portable solution</b>.</p>
        <p>I am able to recognise <b>common patterns</b> (architectural as well as functional) and tailor the solution around them.</p>
        <p>I do not belive that there is a do-all solution, and as such I always try to <b>find the best tools for the job</b> (I don't think the tools I am currently using are the best for all situations). As a recent <b>example</b>, I've learned and wrote a small <b>proof of concept</b> for a <b>large-scale document upload</b> solution using <b>NodeJS</b>, <b>html5</b> and <b>MongoFS</b>.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="software" class="step" data-x="-600" data-y="1600" data-rotate="90" data-scale="3">
        <p>I always try to <b>write the best software</b> I can. I always try to include <b>unit tests</b> and to use <b>Test-Driven Development</b>. I use all the tools that can help me, including <b>DI libraries</b>, <b>refactoring</b>, automated <b>unit tests</b>, <b>CI servers</b>, etc.</p>
        <p>My primary programming languages right now are <b>C#</b> and <b>Javascript</b>. I'm confident in my skills using these languages, and even though I can't say I know everything there is to know about them by heart, I definitely know exactly <b>what to use</b>, <b>when</b> and <b>where</b> to find more information.</p>
        <p>Most of my experience is with <b>Object-Oriented Programming</b>. I know the common OO <b>design patterns</b> and am able to find and apply them properly. I have some experience with <b>functional programming</b>, although I have not had the opportunity to work on any large project using it.</p>
        <p>I also have experience with the following programming languages (most to least experience): <b>C++</b>, <b>SQL</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>x86 assembly</b>, <b>Python</b>, <b>Ruby</b>, <b>CoffeeScript</b>, <b>Clojure</b>, <b>F#</b>, <b>Haskell</b>, <b>LISP</b>.</p>
        <p>Although my primary <b>database</b> engine is SQL (specifically, Microsoft SQL Server), I've used <b>MySQL</b> in the past, and have read about and made small-scale projects using <b>MongoDB</b> and <b>Redis</b>.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="tools" class="step" data-x="-1200" data-y="0" data-z="-1000" data-scale="0.5">
        <h1>Frameworks, libraries and tools</h1>
        <p>As I've already mentioned, I'm mainly using the <b>.NET Framework</b>. I have worked with all versions, including the latest <b>release candidate 4.5</b>.</p>
        <p>I have experience developing web applications using <b>ASP.NET 2.0</b>, and <b>ASP.NET MVC 3</b>. I have written web services using <b>MVC</b>, <b>WCF</b> and <b>asmx</b> as well as <b>Web Api</b>. I am familiar with <b>Silverlight</b>.</p>
        <p>I'll name a few of the <b>libraries</b> I'm using frequently: <b>Entity Framework</b>, <b>xUnit</b>, <b>Moq</b>, <b>Unity</b>, <b>jQuery</b>, <b>Modernizer</b>, <b>KnockoutJS</b>.</p>
        <p>I use <b>Visual Studio</b> (2010 and 2012RC) daily as my main IDE. I also use <b>Sublime</b> for small/fast file editing. I use <b>Fiddler</b> for debugging, along with the <b>Chrome developer tools</b>. I've mostly used <b>TFS</b> for source control, but I've also used <b>Subversion</b> and <b>git</b>.</p>
        <p>I am also somewhat familiar with the <b>Linux</b> environment. I've recently set up a VM running Linux in order to write a proof-of-concept solution using <b>NodeJS</b> and I've found <b>Linux</b> to be better suited for this particular task (as a development environment).</p>

        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>In my <b>10 years</b> of work experience, I've worked as a <b>software developer</b>, <b>project manager</b>, <b>IT consultant</b> and <b>team leader</b>.</p>
        <p>I'm currently working at <b>Teamnet International SA</b> as <b>the M.O.R.E. division tehnical specialist</b>. I'm in charge of <b>designing</b>, <b>developing</b> and <b>improving</b> our <b>cloud-based Software-as-a-Service</b> platform. Since I joined in <b>August 2011</b>, I have improved the platform's <b>usability</b>, <b>stability</b> and <b>performance</b> as well as its <b>logging</b>, <b>reporting</b> and <b>security</b>.</p>
        <p>Since <b>December 2011</b>, I've been assigned to <b>lead a team</b> of three developers to <b>design</b> and <b>implement</b> a custom web-based application. I'm very proud of the result, and so is our customer. The tehnology used was <b>ASP.NET MVC3</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>SQL Server 2008</b>.</p>

        <h1>Web Access SRL</h1>
        <p>Early 2011, I've worked on a <b>4 month project</b> on <b>optimising</b> the performance of a <b>news/CMS website</b> and preparing it for <b>launch</b>. The tehnology used was <b>ASP.NET</b>, <b>Javascript</b>, <b>SQL Server</b>.</p>
        <p>The application had serious <b>performance issues</b>, and I managed to bring it from <b>6-10 second load time</b> for most pages to <b>under 200ms</b>. I have also helped improve the overall <b>architecture</b>, <b>database indexes and structure</b> as well as implement a few <b>key features</b> such as latest news view, comments and importing the current articles from a wordpress blog.</p>

        <p>I've worked at <b>Concept Consulting</b> for almost <b>6 years</b>. It's a small consulting company which specialises on consultance for <b>accessing structural funds</b>.</p>
        <p>During this time, I have designed <b>IT solutions</b> for various companies (basically wrote tehnical papers). I have also implemented the solutions for a few of them with the help of project-based developers.</p>
        <p>Among the <b>tehnical documentations</b> I wrote are: "<b>Project management electronic system</b> (E - ADMINISTRATION ALPAB) for Administration of Lakes, Parks and Leisure Bucharest", "PROACTIVE 6 - e-<b>administration information system as e-government solution</b>", for the Local Public Finances Public Service District 6 and "E-Public Safety and <b>Child Protection Management system</b> DISTRICT 6 - e-government information system" for Social Assistance and Child Protection Institution District 6.

        <p>While <b>Google News</b> was still <b>Beta</b> in mid 2005, I have built my little <b>start-up news website</b> with a couple of friends. I developed it entirely using <b>PHP</b> and <b>MySQL</b>.</p>
        <p>We got accepted into Google News early November and jumped to roughly <b>380,000 visitors</b> in December alone (about <b>550,000 pageviews</b>). The application ran on a <b>shared VM</b> and with a bit of tweaking, I got it working even at peak loads.</p>

        <p>My <b>first job</b> as a programmer was in <b>2002</b>. I was still in <b>high-school</b>, but I found a very interesting project to work on. The scope of the project was monitoring of various <b>physical measurements</b> (air pressure, water level, etc) for water pumps in a dock.</p>
        <p>I helped write some of the <b>assembly</b> required for the <b>custom hardware</b>, as well as manage to get the <b>SMS-based warning system</b> working.</p>

        <p>Like many other software developers, I am <b>self-taught</b>. I read a lot of <b>books</b>, and I follow a lot of <b>blogs</b> and other online sources.</p>
        <p>I have graduated highschool at the <b>"Sf. Sava" National College</b> in Bucharest in 2004.</p>
        <p>I got my <b>university degree</b> in <b>Computer Science</b> at the <b>Romanian-American University</b> in Bucharest in 2008.</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p><b>What can I bring to your company</b>? I know a lot about a lot of different tehnologies. I'm very good at <b>designing new systems</b> or <b>improving</b> existing ones. I also belive I'm very good at <b>improving the whole team</b> by simply sharing what I read and try out, presenting tehnologies and tehniques, etc.</p>
        <p>I've had lots of <b>fun</b> writing this resume, and I sincerely hope you <b>enjoyed</b> reading it too. I'm sure it could have turned out a lot better with the help of a real designer, but then again I'm not aiming for a designer job.</p>
